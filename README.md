ðŸ’¡ Flashcards, simply.

This is a very much **work in progress** - currently there's only Polish translation available and
there are no builds at GitHub, Google Play or AppStore. You can `git clone` the application and
`flutter run` it on your own though.

## Goals

- **Free** - as in "free beer"
- **Simple**, elegant, Material Design interface
- **Server-free** - everything's stored solely on users' phones
- Android & iOS support

## Roadmap

### Before first release

- Add English translation
- Get rid of all the to-dos in docs and code
- Implement Leitner system learning model
- Upload application to Google Play
- Write some tests

### After first release

- Implement more exercise types
- Implement exercising statistics
- Improve UI's interactivity (e.g. animate deleing a deck)
- Optimize UI for tables (currently it's totally unprepared for landscape views)
- Implement graphics cards
- Implement syncing decks via Bluetooth (if it's possible at all)
