# Fiszker

Flashcards, simply.

This is a very much **work in progress** - currently there's only Polish translation available and
there are no builds at GitHub, Google Play or AppStore. You can `git clone` the application and
`flutter run` it on your own though.

## Goals

- Free as in beer
- Modern, material design UI
- Server-free - everything's saved on users' phones only
- Android & iOS support

## Milestones

### 0.1

- Get rid of all the current `@todo`s in both README and code
- Write some tests
- Upload application to Google Play

### 0.2

- Implement English translation
- Implement exercise statistics
- Implement the "pairing sides" exercise
- Improve interface's interactivity (e.g. add an animation after deleting a deck)
- Optimize interface for tablets (currently the application is totally unprepared for landscape views)
- Upload application to AppStore

### 0.3

- Implement graphic cards (instead of text-only, as for now)
- Implement learning models (instead of plain-old exercising - like the Leitner system)

### 0.4

- Implement syncing decks via Bluetooth (if it's possible)
